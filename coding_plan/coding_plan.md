# 1. Decide on your project
What is StoryCoder.dev? StoryCoder.dev is an Open Source Project to which anyone, writers and coders, can contribute. The project consists of writing stories of all genres (comedy, action, detective, love stories, drama, fairy tales, fiction, historical, children‚Äôs stories, etc.). Somewhere in the story there is a code to solve which can be solved in all programming languages you know, for example Dart, Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, Java, Ruby, Erlang, Rust and many more! The aim is to create stories with the respective coding solutions.

We have exciting news! We have decided it is time to start the process of planning and coding ü§©ü§© one part of the website, the most important part, which is the ‚Äústory‚Äù section part, as that part contains most technical features: story texts and updates, AI audios (text to speech), pictures of stories, hashed solution input fields, etc. We will start by üß† brainstorming about technologies and writing a coding plan according to this: https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-plan-a-coding-project . The coding plan will also be visible on the GitHub repo.

The GitHub repo will be the following: https://github.com/roseTech/storycoder.dev-backend and the sub website will be www.stories.storycoder.dev (both story sections will run paralell until the final coded version will be in production). The test site will be: https://stories.practicecoding.dev
The other parts of the website will still be running on wordpress with the ‚Äúastra theme‚Äù and will follow at a later stage (step by step).
